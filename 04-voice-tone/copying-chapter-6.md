## VI

Copying affects each of us every day. Who would not use the command+c and the command+v daily? Or should I say command + foreign and command + own?

I also started copying designs and learning from professionals. As a young man, I stole a lot of work. Although due to my ignorance of programs and clumsiness, it always looked different. Worse. But then I stopped copying what someone had already done. Then I decided to choose only the part of the work I copied. Thanks to the tutorials, I was able to achieve the effect I wanted, and it always revived my work.

I started designing websites and mobile applications a few years ago. I thought about how best to prepare a grid, how to design component sizes, paddings, font sizes, and so on. I thought about it for a long time and I was never completely excited about it after coding. One day, when I was creating one website design, I thought of looking at a free template. I downloaded it and copied all component sizes. Thanks to that, the website reached the ideal size and I was glad that it looks according to my ideas.

Today I try to approach other works as inspiration. For example, I like to watch Behance, where I see who created it. I like case studies because I always know with what intent who used any element on the page, the logic,â€¦
